<h3>Your assignment</h3>

<p>You've been assigned to write an <em>expression evaluator</em>. The input
expressions to your evaluator will be strings in a traditional computer
science notation known as <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression"><em>s-expressions</em></a>,
which is a prefix notation that is fully parenthesized to avoid ambiguity,
for example:</p>

<p><tt>(+ 2 3 4 5)</tt><br />
<tt>(+ 2 3.5)</tt><br />
<tt>(+ 2)</tt><br />
<tt>(+)</tt><br />
<tt>(+ (+ -2 5 -1) 3.5)</tt><br />
<tt>(ceiling 4.7)</tt><br />
<tt>(ceiling 4.0)</tt><br />
<tt>(ceiling -4.7)</tt><br />
<tt>(if 5 7 8.3)</tt><br />
<tt>(if 0 7 8.3)</tt><br />
<tt>(if (+ 2 3) (ceiling 6.1) (+ 4 2.3 2))</tt><br />
<tt>(if (+ 2 -2) (ceiling 6.1) (+ 4 2.3 2))</tt><br />
<tt>(+ 1 (if (+ 2 -2) (ceiling 6.1) (+ 4 2.3 2)))</tt></p>

<p>Notice that you're dealing with three distinct types of atomic elements in
these expressions: <em>ints</em>, <em>doubles</em>, and <em>symbols</em>. The
<em>ints</em> and <em>doubles</em> are two different types of literals used
as operands. In addition, the operator <em>symbols</em> are functions whose
symbol names are <tt>+</tt>, <tt>if</tt>, and <tt>ceiling</tt>.</p>

<p>The <tt>+</tt> operator accepts any number of operands to be added. The
operands can be any mix of ints or doubles. Like in C or C++, the return type
should be double if any of the operands are double, and int otherwise. If no
operands are given, then the result should be zero which is the identity
value for addition.</p>

<p>The <tt>ceiling</tt> operator requires exactly one operand, which must be
a double. It returns an int which is the smallest integer that is greater or
equal to the operand.</p>

<p>The <tt>if</tt> operator requires either two or three operands. It first
checks if the first operand is non-zero. If so, then it should return the
result of evaluating the second operand. Otherwise, it should return the
result of evaluating the third operand (if only two operands were given, then
the return value is undefined, or in other words, you may return anything you
like).</p>

<p>Also notice that operands do not have to be literals. They also can
recursively be sub-expressions.</p>

<p>Given such an input expression, your evaluator should return the result of
evaluating the expression, for example:</p>

<p><tt>(+ 2 3 4 5)</tt> should return the int <tt>14</tt><br />
<tt>(+ 2 3.5)</tt> should return the double <tt>5.5</tt><br />
<tt>(+ 2)</tt> should return the int <tt>2</tt><br />
<tt>(+)</tt> should return the int <tt>0</tt><br />
<tt>(+ (+ -2 5 -1) 3.5)</tt> should return the double <tt>5.5</tt><br />
<tt>(ceiling 4.7)</tt> should return the int <tt>5</tt><br />
<tt>(ceiling 4.0)</tt> should return the int <tt>4</tt><br />
<tt>(ceiling -4.7)</tt> should return the int <tt>-4</tt><br />
<tt>(if 5 7 8.3)</tt> should return the int <tt>7</tt><br />
<tt>(if 0 7 8.3)</tt> should return the double <tt>8.3</tt><br />
<tt>(if (+ 2 3) (ceiling 6.1) (+ 4 2.3 2))</tt> should return the int
<tt>7</tt><br />
<tt>(if (+ 2 -2) (ceiling 6.1) (+ 4 2.3 2))</tt> should return the double
<tt>8.3</tt><br />
<tt>(+ 1 (if (+ 2 -2) (ceiling 6.1) (+ 4 2.3 2)))</tt> should return the
double <tt>9.3</tt></p>

<p>Your expression evaluator should proceed in two independent stages:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Parse</em> the input string to analyze and understand its
    structure. The parser should return a tree data structure in which it
    records (a) the nested structure of the parenthesized expressions and
    sub-expressions, and (b) the types of all the elements in the
  expression.</li>
  <li><em>Evaluate</em> the expression stored in the tree data structure, by
    doing a depth-first traversal. The evaluator should return the value
    resulting from evaluating the entire expression.</li>
</ol>

<p>If there is any error in the types or number of operands in the input
expression, your expression evaluator should print the string <tt>ERROR</tt>
on standard error (<tt>cerr &lt;&lt; "ERROR"</tt>), and call <tt>exit(1)</tt>
to terminate program execution. Otherwise, for this assignment, you may
assume that you will only be tested with input expressions that can safely be
parsed.</p>

<h3>Borrowing someone else's expression parser</h3>

<p>Thankfully, you don't have to write a parser. You've already found a
parser written by someone else, capable of reading and understanding strings
in s-expression format. Download the package at the top of this page,
then:</p>

<p><tt>$ tar xzf a1.tar.gz</tt> <i>// unpack the archive</i><br />
<tt>$ cd a1</tt><br />
<tt>$ make</tt><br />
<tt>g++ -c main.cpp</tt><br />
<tt>g++ -c parse.cpp</tt><br />
<tt>g++ -c eval.cpp</tt><br />
<tt>g++ -c Cell.cpp</tt><br />
<tt>g++ -DOP_ASSIGN -o main main.o parse.o eval.o Cell.o -lm</tt><br />
<tt>$ main testinput.txt</tt></p>

<p>You will see the parser's test program run. You can also run the program
in interactive mode by typing <tt>main</tt> without any command-line
arguments. In interactive mode, the program will prompt you to type in an
expression, and then it'll print the expression back to you, and repeat until
you type control-D to generate an EOF (end-of-file).</p>

<p>You wish to re-use this code for parsing s-expressions. The only problem
is that this parser, as originally written, does not actually build a tree
data structure. So you will need to modify the code to suit the purposes of
this assignment.</p>

<p>But you are lucky that the author of the parser encapsulated his code
quite neatly. You will not even have to touch his parser code (which is in
<tt>parse.hpp</tt> and <tt>parse.cpp</tt>). As the parser analyzes the input
string, it needs to call various operations to record the nested tree
structure that it is finding in the s-expression. The author wisely
encapsulated all these operations and global constants in a separate header
file <tt>cons.hpp</tt> that keeps all the concrete tree implementation
details hidden from the parser:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>Cell* make_int(const int i)</tt> returns a newly constructed int
    cell, i.e., a leaf node initialized to hold the int value <tt>i</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Cell* make_double(const double d)</tt> returns a newly constructed
    double cell, i.e., a leaf node initialized to hold the double value
    <tt>d</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Cell* make_symbol(const char* const s)</tt> returns a newly
    constructed symbol cell, i.e., a leaf node initialized to hold the symbol
    name <tt>s</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Cell* cons(Cell* const my_car, Cell* const my_cdr)</tt> returns a
    newly constructed cons cell, i.e., an internal node initialized to hold
    the two pointers <tt>my_car</tt> and <tt>my_cdr</tt></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><tt>bool intp(Cell* const c)</tt> returns true iff the cell pointed to
    by <tt>c</tt> is an int cell</li>
  <li><tt>bool doublep(Cell* const c)</tt> returns true iff the cell pointed
    to by <tt>c</tt> is a double cell</li>
  <li><tt>bool symbolp(Cell* const c)</tt> returns true iff the cell pointed
    to by <tt>c</tt> is a symbol cell</li>
  <li><tt>bool nullp(Cell* const c)</tt> returns true iff <tt>c</tt> is is
    the null pointer (which is equivalent to the empty list)</li>
  <li><tt>bool listp(Cell* const c)</tt> returns true iff the cell pointed to
    by <tt>c</tt> is a cons cell, or if <tt>c</tt> is the null pointer (i.e.,
    if c points to an empty list)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><tt>extern Cell* const nil</tt> holds the value of a null pointer,
    which we consider equivalent to an empty list</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><tt>int get_int(Cell* const c)</tt> returns the value in the int cell
    pointed to by <tt>c</tt> (error if <tt>c</tt> is not an int cell)</li>
  <li><tt>double get_double(Cell* const c)</tt> returns the value in the
    double cell pointed to by <tt>c</tt> (error if <tt>c</tt> is not a double
    cell)</li>
  <li><tt>string get_symbol(Cell* const c)</tt> returns the value in the
    string cell pointed to by <tt>c</tt> (error if <tt>c</tt> is not a string
    cell)</li>
  <li><tt>Cell* car(Cell* const c)</tt> returns the car pointer of the cons
    cell pointed to by <tt>c</tt> (error if <tt>c</tt> is not a cons
  cell)</li>
  <li><tt>Cell* cdr(Cell* const c)</tt> returns the cdr pointer of the cons
    cell pointed to by <tt>c</tt> (error if <tt>c</tt> is not a cons
  cell)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><tt>ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; os, Cell* const c)</tt>
    prints the cons cell pointed to by <tt>c</tt> to the output stream
    <tt>os</tt>, using s-expression notation</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that even though these are just ordinary functions (not member
functions of a class), nevertheless this set of functions constitutes an
interface for an abstract data type; we'll discuss more background on this
particular ADT below. The way that <tt>cons.hpp</tt> specifies the ADT
interface is nice because it makes very few assumptions about how the
concrete implementation might be done. (Good object-oriented programming
style does <em>not</em> necessarily require using classes! For example, see
Scott Myer's article <a href="http://www.ddj.com/dept/cpp/184401197">How
Non-Member Functions Improve Encapsulation</a>.)</p>

<p>The file <tt>cons.hpp</tt> that came with the parser just connects all the
functions to a dummy example implementation of the ADT that makes use of a
super-simple, incomplete <tt>Cell</tt> class probably written by someone else
(found in <tt>Cell.hpp</tt> and <tt>Cell.cpp</tt>). As mentioned earlier,
this dummy example implementation isn't actually capable of building a tree
data structure with pointers and nodes. Instead, it just records the
sub-trees using a string encoding, rather than a tree data structure. Most of
the functions needed by <tt>cons.hpp</tt> aren't even working yet in the
dummy <tt>Cell</tt> class, since the basic parser can be run without the
accessor functions <tt>intp</tt>, <tt>doublep</tt>, <tt>symbolp</tt>,
<tt>nullp</tt>, <tt>listp</tt>, <tt>get_int</tt>, <tt>get_double</tt>,
<tt>get_symbol</tt>, <tt>car</tt> and <tt>cdr</tt>. You can build trees
without using these accessor functions, although it's not terribly useful
without the accessor functions since nobody can access the tree you've built.
(And in fact, the string encoding that's used is actually just s-expression
notation again! Of course this circular set-up is not terribly useful,
either; it's just a partial example to show you how to work with the
<tt>cons.hpp</tt> ADT interface by connecting it to a concrete implementation
in <tt>Cell.hpp</tt>.)</p>

<p>So the parser author (me) and the tree data structure author (you) both
have interfaces encapsulating our code, helping us to divide and conquer the
work in <em>both</em> directions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>parse.hpp</tt> is the interface that tells you <em>what</em> the
    parser can do, while hiding the dirty implementation details of
    <em>how</em> the parser works (in my <tt>parse.cpp</tt> which your tree
    data structure doesn't get to see).</li>
  <li><tt>cons.hpp</tt> is the interface that tells me what the tree data
    structure can do, while hiding the dirty implementation details of how
    the tree data structure works (in your <tt>Cons.hpp</tt> and
    <tt>Cons.cpp</tt> which my parser doesn't get to see).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adapting the parser to this assignment</h3>

<p>You realize that the cleanest and easiest way to proceed is to leave
<tt>cons.hpp</tt> exactly the way it is. That way, you only need to replace
the <tt>Cell</tt> class with your own implementation. (This is good software
engineering at work, helping you through proper encapsulation!)</p>

<p>You will also stick to re-using the existing interface of the
<tt>Cell</tt> class when implementing your own version of <tt>Cell</tt>; you
won't delete or rename any functions or member functions, to avoid breaking
the parser. (However, you might wish to add some new functions and member
functions, to support manipulating and accessing the tree data structure you
build.)</p>

<p>Looking at the public interface specified by the <tt>Cell</tt> class in
<tt>Cell.hpp</tt>, you see there are a few constructors that the parser's
<tt>cons.hpp</tt> will expect your own implementation to provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>Cell(const int i)</tt> constructs an int cell, i.e., a leaf node
    that holds the int value <tt>i</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Cell(const double d)</tt> constructs a double cell, i.e., a leaf
    node that holds a double value <tt>d</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Cell(const char* const s)</tt> constructs a symbol cell, i.e., a
    leaf node that holds the symbol name <tt>s</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Cell(Cell* const my_car, Cell* const my_cdr)</tt> constructs a cons
    cell, i.e., an internal node that holds two pointers <tt>my_car</tt> and
    <tt>my_cdr</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Other than these constructors, you'll need to implement these public
member functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>bool is_int() const</tt> returns true iff <tt>this</tt> is an int
    cell</li>
  <li><tt>bool is_double() const</tt> returns true iff <tt>this</tt> is a
    double cell</li>
  <li><tt>bool is_symbol() const</tt> returns true iff <tt>this</tt> is a
    symbol cell</li>
  <li><tt>bool is_cons() const</tt> returns true iff <tt>this</tt> is a cons
    cell</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><tt>int get_int() const</tt> returns the value in this int cell (error
    if <tt>this</tt> is not an int cell)</li>
  <li><tt>double get_double() const</tt> returns the value in this double
    cell (error if <tt>this</tt> is not a double cell)</li>
  <li><tt>string get_symbol() const</tt> returns the symbol name in this
    symbol cell (error if <tt>this</tt> is not a symbol cell)</li>
  <li><tt>Cell* get_car() const</tt> returns the car pointer of this cons
    cell (error if <tt>this</tt> is not a cons cell)</li>
  <li><tt>Cell* get_cdr() const</tt> returns the cdr pointer of this cons
    cell (error if <tt>this</tt> is not a cons cell)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><tt>void print(ostream&amp; os) const</tt> prints the subtree rooted at
    this cell, in s-expression notation</li>
</ul>

<p>In <tt>Cell.cpp</tt> you'll also need to define this global constant, that
was declared as an extern in <tt>cons.hpp</tt> (and in <tt>Cell.hpp</tt>
too):</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>Cell* const nil</tt> is the value for a null pointer, which we
    consider equivalent to an empty list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hint: depending on your approach, you could choose either to implement
<tt>nil</tt> as the C++ <tt>NULL</tt> value (the pointer to address zero), or
as some unique dummy <tt>Cell*</tt> value (known as a <em>sentinel</em>, as
you should learn in COMP171). If you don't know what this means yet, then
don't worry and just implement <tt>nil</tt> as the C++ <tt>NULL</tt> value,
exactly as in the dummy version of <tt>Cell.cpp</tt> that we give you. The
following sections discuss how <tt>nil</tt> is used.</p>

<h3>Some background on the cons list ADT</h3>

<p>The abstract data type (ADT) that the parser author chose to use is a
traditional <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language#Conses_and_lists"><em>cons
list</em></a> ADT dating back to around 1958. This ADT only requires a nil or
NULL constant representing an empty list (which can be written <tt>()</tt>
using s-expression notation), plus only three essential core operations <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons"><em>cons</em></a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_and_cdr"><em>car</em></a> and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_and_cdr"><em>cdr</em></a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons"><em>cons</em></a>
    constructs a new list with a given car value and cdr list. For example: 
    <ul>
      <li><tt>cons(1, nil)</tt> returns <tt>(1)</tt></li>
      <li><tt>cons(1, cons(2, nil))</tt> returns <tt>(1 2)</tt></li>
      <li><tt>cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, nil)))</tt> returns <tt>(1 2
      3)</tt></li>
      <li><tt>cons(cons(1, cons(2, nil)), cons(3, nil))</tt> returns <tt>((1
        2) 3)</tt></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_and_cdr"><em>car</em></a>
    gives the value of the head node of the list. For example: 
    <ul>
      <li><tt>car(cons(1, nil))</tt> returns <tt>1</tt></li>
      <li><tt>car(cons(cons(1, nil), nil))</tt> returns <tt>(1)</tt></li>
      <li><tt>car(cons(cons(1, cons(2, nil)), cons(3, nil)))</tt> returns
        <tt>(1 2)</tt></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_and_cdr"><em>cdr</em></a>
    (pronounced "could-er" or "cudder") gives the list after the head node.
    For example: 
    <ul>
      <li><tt>cdr(cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, nil))))</tt> returns <tt>(2
      3)</tt></li>
      <li><tt>cdr(cons(cons(1, cons(2, nil)), cons(3, nil)))</tt> returns
        <tt>(3)</tt></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Building up large trees this way can get a bit tedious, so in practice
typically people also define equivalent shorthand functions. Mathematically
speaking, such functions are not really necessary, and exist only for the
sake of convenience. For example,</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language#Conses_and_lists"><em>list</em></a>
    builds a new list containing the operands. For example: 
    <ul>
      <li><tt>list(1)</tt> is shorthand for <tt>cons(1, nil)</tt> and returns
        <tt>(1)</tt></li>
      <li><tt>list(1, 2, 3)</tt> is shorthand for <tt>cons(1, cons(2, cons(3,
        nil)))</tt> and returns <tt>(1 2 3)</tt></li>
      <li><tt>list(list(1, 2), 3)</tt> is shorthand for <tt>cons(cons(1,
        cons(2, nil)), cons(3, nil))</tt> and returns <tt>((1 2) 3)</tt></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To keep your life simple, you are <em>not</em> required to implement
<tt>list</tt> even though we'll use it in written examples later.</p>

<h3>Implementing the cons list ADT</h3>

<p>How do you implement the cons list ADT? In fact there exist many different
implement approaches.</p>

<p>You've decided to use the most traditional approach, which is to
extend your singly linked list data structure from <a
href="http://www.cs.ust.hk/~dekai/2012H/assignments/a0/html/">Assignment 0</a>. This is the most natural
and intuitively obvious way to implement the cons list ADT. As explained in
<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_programming_language#Lists">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<p>Specifically, each node in the linked list is a cons cell, also called a
pair. As the name pair implies, a cons cell consists of two values: the first
one is the <tt>car</tt>, and the second is the <tt>cdr</tt>. For <tt>list(1,
2, 3)</tt>, there are three cons cells, or pairs. The first cons cell has the
number 1 in the first slot, and a pointer to the second cons cell in the
second. The second cons cell has the number 2 in the first slot, and a
pointer to the third cons cell in the second slot. The third cons cell has
the number 3 in the first slot and a NULL constant in the second slot. The
NULL constant is usually represented by <tt>()</tt>. The cons function
constructs these cons cells, which is why <tt>cons(1, list(2, 3))</tt> gives
the list <tt>(1 2 3)</tt>. <!-- If both of the arguments are not lists, then a pair is created,
  usually represented with a dot. For example, (cons 1 2) gives (1 . 2),
  where the cons cell consists of 1 and 2 in its slots instead of a pointer
  to another cons cell in its second slot. -->
 </p>

<p>Here's a picture of the linked list to hold <tt>((1 2) 3)</tt>, using
what's known as box-and-pointer notation. Notice how it naturally matches the
exact structure of <tt>cons(cons(1, cons(2, nil)), cons(3, nil))</tt>.
There's one box for each <tt>cons</tt>, and two <tt>nil</tt> pointers.</p>
<img src="boxandpointer.jpg" /> 

<p>In Assignment 0, cells could hold three kinds of values, but here, they can hold four kinds of values: int, double,
symbol, and cons. You will continue to use a tagged union approach,
but in Assignment 1 we will move from C to C++: instead of
old-fashioned simple structs, we'll use classes that
can contain member types and functions:</p>
<pre>class Cell {
  // ...
  enum TypeTag {type_int, type_double, type_symbol, type_conspair};
  TypeTag tag_m;
  union {
    int int_m;
    double double_m; 
    char* symbol_m;
    ConsPair conspair_m;
  };
};</pre>

<p>We move the definition <tt>TypeTag</tt>
into the scope of <tt>Cell</tt>, taking advantage of C++'s classes to
better encapsulate the symbols we're defining, to be as closely
associated as possible with the classes they're used with.</p>

<h3>Evaluating the expression tree</h3>

<p>After you've gotten the parser to store the expression into your real tree
data structure (your concrete implementation of the cons list ADT), now you
need to write a function that evaluates it.</p>

<p>To do this, you merely need to perform a depth-first traversal starting
from the root. As you complete each subtree, the evaluator should return the
value resulting from evaluating the sub-expression stored in that subtree. By
the time you finish the entire traversal, you will be back at the root---so
the evaluator should return the value resulting from evaluating the entire
expression.</p>

<p>The problem is: what is the <em>type</em> that should be returned by your
evaluator function?</p>

<p>It would seem that this depends on the type of the operands---remember,
from the introduction:</p>

<p><tt>(+ 2 3 4 5)</tt> should return the int <tt>14</tt><br />
<tt>(+ 2 3.5)</tt> should return the double <tt>5.5</tt><br />
<tt>(+ (+ 3 -1) 3.5)</tt> should return the double <tt>5.5</tt><br />
<tt>(if 5 7 8.3)</tt> should return the int <tt>7</tt><br />
<tt>(if 0 7 8.3)</tt> should return the double <tt>8.3</tt><br />
<tt>(if (+ 2 3) (+ 4 3) (+ 6 2.3))</tt> should return the int <tt>7</tt><br />
<tt>(if (+ 2 -2) (+ 4 3) (+ 6 2.3))</tt> should return the double
<tt>8.3</tt><br />
<tt>(+ 1 (if (+ 2 -2) (+ 4 3) (+ 6 2.3)))</tt> should return the double
<tt>9.3</tt><br />
<tt>(ceiling 4.7)</tt> should return the int <tt>5</tt><br />
<tt>(ceiling -4.7)</tt> should return the int <tt>-4</tt></p>

<p>But C++ won't let us write a function that returns different types
depending on the result!</p>

<p>To solve this problem, we'll re-use your <tt>Cell</tt> implementation.
Remember, <tt>Cell</tt> already gives us a way to store different types of
values in the same class type, by using a tagged union. So your function
evaluator should return a <tt>Cell*</tt> that points to a <tt>Cell</tt>
holding the value resulting from evaluating the expression:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>Cell* eval(Cell* const c)</tt> returns the value resulting from
    evaluating the expression tree whose root is pointed to by <tt>c</tt>
    (error if <tt>c</tt> is not a well-formed expression)</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll find this declaration in the header file <tt>eval.hpp</tt>, which
you should not alter. Place your implementation for the evaluator in your own
<tt>eval.cpp</tt> file, replacing the dummy <tt>eval.cpp</tt> that came with
the parser.</p>

<p>When you're implementing the <tt>eval</tt> function, think carefully about
all the different cases (what type are the operands?) The <tt>+</tt> and
<tt>if</tt> functions can be applied to any combination of the numeric int
and double types, but what is the return type? The <tt>ceiling</tt> function
can be applied to double types, but not int types. No function can be applied
to the symbol type (yet).</p>

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Notice that the dummy example implementation of <tt>eval.cpp</tt> that you
have been given doesn't do anything useful. It just returns the same
<tt>Cell*</tt> that was passed to it. That's why running the <tt>main</tt>
program prints out the same s-expression that you give it as input. After
you've correctly replaced <tt>eval.cpp</tt> with your real evaluator
implementation, running the same <tt>main</tt> program will instead print out
the result of evaluation---which is exactly what we want!</p>

<p>So you don't need to touch <tt>main.cpp</tt> at all. Good encapsulation at
work, again!</p>

<h3>Important reminders</h3>

<p>You must follow the design approach outlined in this document. Do
<em>not</em> just implement the required functionality using a different
design. Your proper <em>software engineering</em> skills are being graded.</p>

<p>Do <em>not</em> use virtual functions or templates in this assignment.
This assignment is about static OO support in C++. (You'll get a chance to
use dynamic OO polymorphism and templates in the following assignments...)</p>

<p>Do <em>not</em> edit the files <tt>parse.hpp</tt>, <tt>parse.cpp</tt>,
<tt>cons.hpp</tt>, <tt>eval.hpp</tt>, or <tt>main.cpp</tt>. The programming
assignments are mini-exercises in how multiple programmers are supposed to
interact and communicate in the real world; these files are <em>owned</em>
and <em>maintained</em> by the other author(s).</p>

<p>You will need to add things to <tt>Cell.hpp</tt>, but do <em>not</em>
delete anything from it. Replace the files <tt>Cell.cpp</tt> and
<tt>eval.cpp</tt> with your own implementations. Depending on your approach,
you may or may not also wish to add more files.</p>

<p>Depending on your approach, you may or may not need to change the
<tt>Makefile</tt> (as in Lab 1). Whether you changed it or not, always make
sure you include whatever <tt>Makefile</tt> is needed to build your program,
when you submit the assignment. Otherwise, the graders cannot build your
program.</p>

<p>Documentation is also a critically important part of your software
engineering. Your use of <tt>doxygen</tt> comments, as in Lab 3, will be
graded.</p>

<p>You must write the final version of the program on your own. Sophisticated
plagiarism detection systems are in operation, and they are pretty good at
catching copying! If you worked in study groups, you must also acknowledge
your collaborators in the write-up for each problem, whether or not they are
classmates. Other cases will be dealt with as plagiarism. Re-read the policy
on the course home page, and note the University's tougher policy this year
regarding cheating.</p>

<p>Your programming style (how clearly and how well you speak C++) is what
will be graded. Correct functioning of your program is necessary but not
sufficient!</p>

<h3>Grading scheme</h3>

<p>Below is the <strong>grading sheet</strong> that will be used by the
graders, so you can see what software engineering skills they're checking you
for.</p>

<p>Your grade consists of two parts: (1) <strong>program
correctness</strong>, worth 60%. and (2) <strong>style &amp; design</strong>,
worth 40%. Points are deducted for the error types as shown (but the minimum
you can get for each part is 0%, so you cannot get negative point scores on
either program correctness or style &amp; design).</p>

<p>To assist you with your own testing and debugging, examples of the simple,
general, and invalid input test cases (similar to the real ones that will be
used by the graders) are found in the files <tt>testinput_simple.txt</tt>,
<tt>testinput_general.txt</tt>, and <tt>testinput_invalid.txt</tt>,
respectively. The correct results for the valid cases are found in the files
<tt>testreference_simple.txt</tt> and <tt>testreference_general.txt</tt>.</p>
